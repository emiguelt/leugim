### Signals and Slots

* Setter methods are natural slots. By making all setters slots, you guarantee that you can connect signals to all interesting parts of your class. The only time when a setter should not also be a slot is when the setter accepts some very custom type that you are sure will never come from a signal.

* When matching arguments, the match is checked only for the arguments accepted by the slot. This means that a slot that does not take any arguments matches all signals. The arguments not accepted by the slot are simply dropped by the signal-emitting code.
