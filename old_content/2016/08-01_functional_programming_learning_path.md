__IN PROGRESS...__

My path:

- Book SICP From beginning until Streams
- Clojure marathon
- Learn RX + Video QCon
- Read: Notes on reactive programming (3 parts): https://spring.io/blog/2016/06/07/notes-on-reactive-programming-part-i-the-reactive-landscape
- Functional patterns (WHICH CHAPTERS???)
- Thinking functional (Curry & ????)
- Web dev with Clojure (which???)
