# <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank">Deep Work</a> - Cal Newport
-----------------------
Excellent book for people looking how to improve their focus on knowledge tasks and get things done.

The book is divided in two main parts, in the first one, the author justifies why it is important to be focus and having a well structured strategy to reach our objective. The second part presents a set of 4 rules to follow in order to improve our performance in the activities we are interested in.

## Some ideas

I have extracted some ideas/phrases/principles/rules I found relevant for me and maybe are interested for you.

* Being a always-connected person is harmful for your focus and to accomplish your objectives, in general, any non-planned distraction affects negatively directly our performance
* **Rule 1**: Work deeply: Have a dedicated time to depth work, 4 hours is the maximum for continuous deep work. There a 4 types of deep work (check the book)
  * Make a _ritual_ to start your deep work journey. Have a dedicate space for your work (free of distractions). Maybe, go to a different place to get a deeper session.
* Share ideas & knowledge with colleagues
* Have metrics of your work. Take a rest (not just vacations)
* **Rule 2**: Embrace boredom. _"Don't take breaks from Distraction. Instead take breaks from Focus"_
* Give priority to the more important task. Memorize a deck of cards

---------------------------------------

Seeing obstacles as challenges give us a different mindset to reach our objectives. This book presents excellent examples/hints to make things happen and do not die in the process 

## Some ideas

* We must try:
 * To be objective
 * To control emotions and keep an even keel
 * To choose to see the good in a situation
 * To steady our nerves
 * To ignore what disturbs or limits others
 * To place things in perspective
 * To revert to the present moment
 * To focus on what can be controlled
* Focus on the moment, not the monsters that may or may not be up ahead
* Think different. Our perceptions determine what we are and are not capable. We don't control reality, our perceptions do influence it
* Obstacles are **Opportunities** to learn/improve/make it better
* Once you see the world as it is, you must act
* Try, try and try, but not doing the same, analyze results, think different and try something new. Be persistent
* Facing obstacles, look for weak points
* Even failing, your benefit from learning. Every fail is an opportunity to learn and be better
* Follow the process: face a problem/obstacle one step at a time
* Do your job, do it right. Do hard work, honestly, and helping others as best as we can
* Be pragmatic, if you have a mission, make the impossible to accomplish it. If following the rules you find obstacles, try other ways to reach your target.
* To overthrow an obstacle does not need a direct action always, you can wait to go back to see other options or make the obstacle smaller
* Focus is what really matters, that is, no necessarily in what the people thinks or waits, but what you need to reach your target

------------------------------------

I've worked in software development using Linux since university, but I never read a Linux book. 
This book presents a good introduction-to-middle information about Linux, how this OS is composed and how its components interacts.

It starts from Basic to advanced in a good way that lets the reader to understand while advances in the reading.

* **Chapter 1**: Introduction to Kernel and basic concepts (memory management, processes, user space, exec, fork, syscalls, etc)

Very short book about having success in the live. The book is a first-person story about how a man become rich, then poor and again rich, and gives six lessons to change the reader's life.

"_It is claimed that many who read or hear this story almost immediately begin to have good fortune so it is worth a few minutes of your time to find out if it works for you._"
