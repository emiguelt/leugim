# Deep Work - Cal Newport
-----------------------
Excelent book for people looking how to improve their focus on knowledge tasks and get things done.

The book is divided in two main parts, in the first one, the author justifies why it is important to be focus and having a well structured strategy to reach our objective. The second part presents a set of 4 rules to follow in order to improve our performance in the activities we are interested in.

## Some ideas
I have extracted some ideas/phrases/principles/rules I found relevant for me and maybe are interested for you.

* Being a always-connected person is nosive for your focus and to acomplish your objetives, in general, any non-planned distraction affects negatively directly our performance
* **Rule 1**: Work deeply: Have a dedicated time to depth work, 4 hours is the maximum for continuous deep work. There a 4 types of deep work (check the book)
* Make a _ritual_ to start your deep work jorney. Have a dedicate space for your work (free of distractions). Maybe, go to a diferent place to get a deeper session.
* Share ideas & knowledge with collegues
* Have metrics of your work. Take a rest (not just vacations)
* **Rule 2**: Embrace boredom. _"Don't take breaks from Distraction. Instead take breaks from Focus"_
* Give priority to the more important task. Memorize a deck of cards
