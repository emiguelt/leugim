# <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank">Deep Work</a> - Cal Newport
-----------------------
Excelent book for people looking how to improve their focus on knowledge tasks and get things done.

The book is divided in two main parts, in the first one, the author justifies why it is important to be focus and having a well structured strategy to reach our objective. The second part presents a set of 4 rules to follow in order to improve our performance in the activities we are interested in.

## Some ideas

I have extracted some ideas/phrases/principles/rules I found relevant for me and maybe are interested for you.

* Being a always-connected person is nosive for your focus and to acomplish your objetives, in general, any non-planned distraction affects negatively directly our performance
* **Rule 1**: Work deeply: Have a dedicated time to depth work, 4 hours is the maximum for continuous deep work. There a 4 types of deep work (check the book)
* Make a _ritual_ to start your deep work jorney. Have a dedicate space for your work (free of distractions). Maybe, go to a diferent place to get a deeper session.
* Share ideas & knowledge with collegues
* Have metrics of your work. Take a rest (not just vacations)
* **Rule 2**: Embrace boredom. _"Don't take breaks from Distraction. Instead take breaks from Focus"_
* Give priority to the more important task. Memorize a deck of cards

---------------------------------------

Seeing obstacles as challenges give us a different mindset to reach our objectives. This book presents excelent examples/hints to make things happen and do not die in the process 

## Some ideas

* We must try:
 * To be objective
 * To control emotions and keep an even keel
 * To choose to see the good in a situation
 * To steady our nerves
 * To ignore what disturbes or limits others
 * To place things in perspective
 * To rever to the present moment
 * To focus on what can be controlled
* Focus on the moment, not the monsters that may or may not be up ahead
* Think different. Our perceptions determine what we are and are not capable. We don't control reality, our perceptions do influence it
* Obstacles are **Oportunities** to learn/improve/make it better
* Once you see the world as it is, you must act
* Try, try and try, but not doing the same, analyze results, think different and try something new. Be persistent
* Facing obstacles, look for weak points
* Even failing, your benefit from learning. Every fail is an oportunity to learn and be better
* Follow the process: face a problem/obstacle one step at a time
* Do your job, do it right. Do hard work, honestly, and helping others as best as we can
* Be pragmatic, if you have a mission, make the imposible to acomplish it. If following the rules you find obstacles, try other ways to reach your target.

I've worked in software development using linux since university, but I never read a Linux book. 
This book presents a good introduction-to-middle information about Linux, how this OS is composed and how its components interacts.

It starts from Basic to advanced in a good way that lets the reader to understand while advances in the reading.

* **Chapter 1**: Introduction to Kernel and basic concepts (memory management, processes, user space, exec, fork, syscalls, etc)
