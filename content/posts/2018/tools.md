This entry coverages some tools I found useful during my work in software development (Windows and Linux), most of the open source

* <a href="https://dbeaver.io/" target="_blank">DBeaver</a>: as its site says, a Universsal Database tool
* <a href="https://conemu.github.io/" target="_blank">ConEmu</a>: Excellent terminal emulator for Windows, something like "tmux" (not as sophisticated), and compatible wit many terminals (cmd, powershel, git-bash :), etc)
