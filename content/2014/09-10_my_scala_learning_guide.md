Learning Scala language is being a little challenging, first, because functional programming is a really different paradigm for software development, and second, because there are many resources (links, tutorials, books) and sometimes it is a difficult to decide what to read or what to follow to continue in the learning process.

This guide is not about teaching Scala language, it is about showing the steps I've been following to learn Scala, I will include useful references I've read and the methodology I'm applying to get started with this language.

I'm a newbie in Scala, and also a newbie in making learning guides, but maybe some of my experiences in this process are helpful for anybody wanting to learn Scala.

## Organization
I'm going to split this article in three sections, first it is  described quickly my learning methodology, then it is shown I have done, which has been the references/resources I've studied, and finally, an unordered list of resources I've found to choose the next step in my process.

### Note
This article is still in development, so the contents will change in any moment.

## 1. Methodoloy

## 2. Step by Step

 1. **Follow** the Functional programming principles in Scala online course at <a href='https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun' target='_blank'>Coursera</a>

## 3. Resources to choose next step
